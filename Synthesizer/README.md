After adding sound waves, widgets will appear on the screen. The user has the option to move the widgets around the screen. The mixer widget can be used to mix multiple sound waves together. In order to hear the produced sound, the user must connect the out of the sound wave widgets to the volume and set both the frequency(s) and volume to something greater than 0 then connect the volume to the speaker and press play:
