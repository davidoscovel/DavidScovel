# Lunar Lander Project

### Summary
This was my first significant project. After just a couple of weeks of learning how to program, I worked with a partner to recreate a simple version of the old Lunar Lander arcade game. 

### Tools
C++, SFML, Github

### Preview
The goal is to land the vessel smoothly on the colored platforms to earn as many points as possible before running out of fuel. More points are awarded for landing on smaller platforms. Here's an image of what the game looks like:
