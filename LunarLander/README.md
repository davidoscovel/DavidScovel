# Lunar Lander Project

### Summary
This was my first significant project. After just a couple of weeks of learning how to program, I worked with a partner to recreate a simple version of the old Lunar Lander arcade game. 

### Tools
C++, SFML, Github

### Preview
The goal is to land smoothly on the colored platforms to earn as many points as possible before running out of fuel.
